# Movie Recommender System

Source Code for STAT 542: PSL - Project 4. UIUC.

This repository contains the source code for the R Shiny application hosted at: https://kashifmkhan.shinyapps.io/movie-recommender/.

---

# Summary

This application utilizes a portion of the MovieLens data to recommend movies to a user based on two different systems. System 1 allows a user to specify a genre, and the movies returned are recommended by a content-based recommender system based on weighted average rating. System 2 asks a user to rate a set of movies, and then those ratings are used as historical data and recommendations are generated for the user based on item-based collaborative filtering. The user is able to select the system they wish to use via the sidebar.

This project was done in R, and deployed on RShiny.
